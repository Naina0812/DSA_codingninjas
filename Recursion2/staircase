int staircase(int n) {

   *  Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
   *  Return output and don't print it.
   *  Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.

  if (n == 1 || n == 2)
{
    return n;
}else if(n==3){
    return n+1;
}

int recal1 = staircase( n-1);
int recal2 = staircase( n-2);
int recal3 = staircase( n-3);
return recal1+recal2+recal3;
